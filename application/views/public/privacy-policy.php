        <div class="section-text"><strong>Information collected by our desktop applications</strong> (Mac, Windows and Linux): We may also collect screenshots, applications currently being worked on, web URLs visited, time you are active, the operating system you are using, whether

            keyboard is being typed on.</div>
        <div class="section-text"><strong>Note:</strong> Hubstaff is not a keylogging program. It does not know what you are typing; rather, Hubstaff merely records whether your keyboard is active or inactive. All Well Pass Today screenshots are uploaded via SSL over the standard HTTPS
            port (443). Our input clients do all screenshot uploading directly to Amazon S3 (screenshots never pass through our server). We do not upload keystrokes. (We do not even store keystrokes locally.) We upload the total seconds within a 10 min
            block that there was "activity" and the total seconds "worked" roughly every 10 minutes. This is done via a separate queue within the client which uses SSL (port 443). Additionally, your screenshots are obfuscated on Amazon's servers.</div>

            are advised to check your current browser settings to ensure that the settings reflect your consent for Well Pass Today to place cookies on your devices. You do not have to accept our cookies and you may set your browser to restrict their use and
            you may delete them after they have been placed on your hard drive. If you do not accept or delete our cookies, some areas of our websites may take more time to work, or may not function properly.</div>
            <div class="section-text"><strong>Information collected by the Hubstaff mobile app</strong> (iOS and Android): Hubstaff uses the GPS device on your phone to store its location and display this on a map at Well Pass Today.com and your mobile device. This data is only collected
                if the mobile app is being used.</div>
            <div class="section-text"><strong>Other web technologies:</strong> Our Service Providers (defined below) may also use other standard web-based technologies to analyze your movements while accessing our Services. The technologies include web "beacons," "pixel tags,"
                and "clear gifs." These technologies help us ascertain the effectiveness of our product and service campaigns and marketing programs, allow us to customize the services offered on or through our websites, and help determine the best use
                for websites content, and product and service offerings. Some of this information, including the IP address, may be stored on our Service Provider’s server logs, and may be available for extended periods of time.</div>

                their functionality to you where such processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by our Service Providers related to the Services. Where appropriate, we may rely on alternate legal bases, such
                as your consent to certain types of processing. We will not share, sell, rent, or otherwise disclose your personal data to third parties without your consent or another valid legal basis permitted by law.</div>
            <div class="section-text">We will share your information in the following circumstances on the legal basis of the legitimate interests of providing the requested Services:</div>
            <div class="section-text"><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We use third parties to support our business and provide services such as receiving, processing and fulfilling orders, encrypting credit card data as a further measure of securing the data, processing credit

                    <li>to contractors we use to support our business (such as fulfillment services, technical support, delivery services, and financial institutions) or assist in providing the Services, in which case we will require such third parties to
                        agree to treat your personal data in accordance with this policy and use it for the same purposes;</li>
                    <li>in connection about the sale, assignment, merger or other transfer of the business of this site to which the information relates, in which case we will require any such buyer to agree to treat your personal data in accordance with

                    <li>to respond to law enforcement requests or where required by applicable laws, court orders, or government regulations.</li>

            <div class="section-text"><strong>Safety and Lawful Requests:</strong> We may be required to disclose Services user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We generally do not disclose user
                information unless we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. We may share your information when we believe it is necessary to comply with applicable
                laws, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Services or using our name, or to protect the safety of any person. This may include sharing information with other companies,
                lawyers, agents, or government agencies. Nothing in this policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s or request to disclose your information.
                <div class="section-text"><strong>Social gatherings:</strong> If you are a business or organization that has scheduled a conference, event, or meeting at one of our facilities, we may also share your personal data with our event organizers. We also use return e-mail

            <div class="section-text">You may benefit from a number of rights in relation to your information that we process. Some rights apply only in certain limited cases, depending on your location. If you would like to manage, change, limit, or delete your personal data,
                you can do so by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@Well Pass Today.com">privacy@Well Pass Today.com</a>. Upon request, we will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal data. In certain cases where we process your
                information, you may also have a right to restrict or limit the ways in which we use your personal data. In certain circumstances, you also have the right to request the deletion of your personal data, and to obtain a copy of your personal
                data in an easily accessible format.</div>
            <div class="section-text">To the extent that such rights are mandated by the laws applicable to the individual data subject, such as all data subjects residing in the European Union (“EU”), the following rights may apply:
                <ol>
                    <li>the right to access (GDPR, Article 15);</li>
                    <li>the right to rectification (GDPR, Article16);</li>

                assistance regarding your rights, please contact us using the contact information provided below and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable law. In some cases our ability to uphold these rights for you may depend upon
                our obligations to process personal information for security, safety, fraud prevention reasons, compliance with regulatory or legal requirements, or because processing is necessary to deliver the services you have requested. Where this
                is the case, we will inform you of specific details in response to your request.</div>
            <div class="section-text">If we process your information based on our legitimate interests as explained in this policy, or in the public interest, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will cease processing your information unless
                we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for legal reasons. Where we use your data for direct marketing purposes, you can always object using the unsubscribe link in such communications or changing
                your account settings.</div>

                otherwise described in this policy. We also retain log files for internal analysis purposes. These log files are generally retained for a brief period of time, except in cases where they are used for site safety and security, to improve
                site functionality, or we are legally obligated to retain them for longer time periods. We may delete your personal data from our systems as part of a data retention plan. Following termination or deactivation of a Services Account, we
                may retain your information and content for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, and audit purposes.</div>

            <h5>7. Data security</h5>
            <div class="section-text">The security of your personal data is important to us. We take reasonable efforts to secure and protect the privacy, accuracy, and reliability of your information and to protect it from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration
                and destruction. We implement security measures as we deem appropriate and consistent with industry standards. As no data security protocol is impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of our systems or databases, nor can we guarantee
                that personal data we collect about you will not be breached, intercepted, destroyed, accessed, or otherwise disclosed without authorization. Accordingly, any information you transfer to or from Services is provided at your own risk.</div>
            <div
                class="section-text">Please do your part to help us keep your information secure. Services Account information is protected by a password. It is important that you protect against unauthorized access to your account and information by choosing your password carefully
                and by keeping your password and computer secure, such as by signing out after using the Services. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and Services Account, and are fully responsible for all activities
                that occur under your password or Services Account. We specifically reserve the right to terminate your access to the Services and any contract you have with us related to the Services in the event it learns or suspects you have disclosed
                your Services Account or password information to an unauthorized third party.</div>
                <div class="section-text">We make reasonable efforts to ensure that our other Service Providers have implemented physical, electronic, and procedural security measures to assist with safeguarding your personal data, and to help protect against unauthorized access
                    and disclosure. Only our authorized personnel and our Service Providers who perform legitimate business functions for Hubstaff are authorized to access your personal data. Notwithstanding our efforts, the Internet has inherent security
                    risks. Hubstaff cannot promise, and you should not expect, that your personal data, personal searches, and other communications will always remain secure. You should take care with regard to how you handle and disclose your personal
                    data or any username or password that you are required to use to access services on our websites.</div>
                <h5>8. Data Protection Responsibilities</h5>
                <div class="section-text">Where you act for a company processing personal data, or where you provide us the personal data of individuals, you are acting as a data controller, and Hubstaff is the data processor. As a data controller, you are responsible for protecting
                    the personal data you process and complying with all relevant legal requirements when you use the Services. This includes applicable data protection and privacy laws that govern the ways in which you can use personal data. Data controllers
                    are also responsible for protecting personal data they provide to their data processors and must have a written agreement in place governing the details of the processing. You may find Well Pass Today’s standard data processor agreement linked
                    via the Services, or contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@Well Pass Today.com">privacy@Well Pass Today.com</a> to request a copy.</div>

                <div class="section-text">Well Pass Today Operates from the United States: The United States, European Economic Area (“EEA”) Member States, and other countries all have different laws relating to privacy and data protection. When your information is moved from your home
