    <h5>2. License for use of the service; identity authentication</h5>
    <p>The Service is licensed for use only under these Terms. Hubstaff reserves all rights not expressly granted to You, including title and exclusive ownership of the Service, any and all software or updates thereto and source code for the Service.</p>
    <p>Upon registering for the Service, Hubstaff gives You the right to install the Service for use by the total number of Users You identify and authorize. The Service may not be used or accessed by (a) individuals who are not named individuals; or (b)
        any other software or hardware device that does not require a named individual to use or access it. A named individual means an individual identified by You by name who is authorized to use the Service, regardless of how such access occurs or
        if such individual uses any hardware or software that reduces the apparent number of users who are using the Service, such as by using a terminal service. The Service may not be used or accessed by any other software or hardware device that does
        not require an individual to use or access it. Hubstaff reserves the right at any time to require You to provide a list of the named individual(s).</p>
    <p>You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute or sublease the Service. These Terms will govern any upgrades provided by Hubstaff that replace and/or supplement the original Service. You agree to use your best efforts to protect the Service and
        upgrades from unauthorized use, reproduction, distribution, publication or alteration.</p>
    <h5>3. Hubstaff Talent</h5>
    <p>Hubstaff provides the Hubstaff Talent application to its Users at no charge. Hubstaff does not condition a User’s participation in Hubstaff Talent on the use or purchase of any other Hubstaff products or services (or vice versa). Hubstaff does not
        condition the receipt of any benefit to a Hubstaff Talent user upon the use of any other Hubstaff product or service.</p>
    <h5>4. Installation, customization, and updates</h5>
    <p>Installation of the Service and any required modification of the Service to accommodate Your computer system must be performed by You. All updates, upgrades, enhancements and modifications to the Service MUST be performed by Hubstaff. Such updates
        include any changes or improvements to the Service, whether arising out of the Service’s particular configuration for Your use or otherwise. At all times while these Terms are in effect, You shall provide Hubstaff with access to Your computer
        system so that Hubstaff may install all updates. Failure to allow Hubstaff to install updates or to compensate Hubstaff for the installation of updates automatically terminates all warranties for any purpose related to the Service as well as Your
        license to use the Service.</p>
    <h5>5. Term and fees</h5>
    <p>Provided prior notice of pricing is given to You, Hubstaff reserves the right to charge You for use of the Service on a periodic (e.g., weekly or monthly) basis or otherwise. These Terms shall begin upon Your registration for the Services and shall
        continue until Your use of the Service is terminated by you or by Hubstaff. You are responsible for all fees due to Hubstaff and any compensation due to any Marketplace Member prior to the termination date.</p>
    <h5>6. Termination</h5>
    <p>Upon the termination of these Terms, the Service and all updates may cease to properly function and all warranties, express or implied, regarding the Service shall terminate. Your rights under these terms will automatically terminate without notice
        from the Hubstaff if You fail to comply with any provision of these Terms. Further, Hubstaff may terminate the Service for any action taken by You that Hubstaff believes in its sole discretion is an inappropriate use of the Service even if not
        specifically detailed by these Terms, including, any use of the Service that is prohibited by federal, state, or local law. Any warranty regarding the Service will automatically terminate without notice if You fail to comply with any provision
        these Terms. The parties expressly acknowledge and agree that all provisions of these Terms that concern Copyright or other protectable interests of Hubstaff shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding termination of any warranty or
        use of the Service.</p>
    <h5>7. Proprietary nature of the service</h5>
    <p>The Service and Platform are proprietary to, and valuable trade secrets of Hubstaff. You acknowledge the Service contains proprietary content, information and material that is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including,
        but not limited to, copyright, trademark, and service marks, and that You will only use such proprietary content, information, or materials for permitted uses under these Terms. The Service is entrusted to You only for the purposes set forth in
        these Terms. You will not reverse engineer, duplicate, translate, modify, copy, printout, disassemble, decompile or otherwise tamper with the Service or any software provided therewith. The parties acknowledge that any violation of this provision
        will cause irreparable harm to Hubstaff. As a consequence, the parties agree that if You fail to abide by these Terms, Hubstaff will be entitled to specific performance, including immediate issuance of a temporary restraining order or preliminary
        injunction enforcing these Terms, and to judgment for damages caused by such breach, and to any other remedies provided by law.</p>
    <h5>8. Consent to use of data</h5>

        information about Your device, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of customization, updates, and other services to You (if any) related to the Service. Hubstaff may use this
        information, to improve the Service or to provide services or technologies to You. Hubstaff treats personally identifiable information differently from general information. Personally identifiable information can be used to identify, locate or
        contact You. General information is information that is not personally identifiable information and is not associated with personally identifiable information. Hubstaff may convert personally identifiable information into general information by
        excluding information that is personally identifiable. You acknowledge that general information belongs to Hubstaff and that Hubstaff has the right to use such general information as it determines in its sole discretion. Hubstaff may process information
        in the country where it was collected, as well as other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of personal information may be less stringent than the laws in Your country. Hubstaff uses personally identifiable
        information for its own internal purposes, including contacting You via email to inform you about updates to the Service and providing You with information relating to transactions that you conduct on the Hubstaff’s website. Hubstaff provides
        personally identifiable information to third parties who process it in accordance with Hubstaff’s instructions in order for Hubstaff to provide services to You (including processing payments for use of the Service). Hubstaff reserves the right
        to disclose Your information if Hubstaff has a good-faith belief that the disclosure is (a) required by law, regulation, or legal process; (b) appropriate to detect, prevent, or remedy violations of these Terms, fraud, security, or technical issues;
        or (c) permitted in order to protect Hubstaff, other Users, or the public. If Hubstaff is involved in a change of control through sale of assets or otherwise, we will give notice before your personally identifiable information is transferred or
        becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
    <h5>9. Content and linking to other websites</h5>
    <p>The Service may enable access to the Hubstaff Talent and the parties’ websites, as well as the websites of third parties (collectively, the "Websites"). The Websites may display, include, or make available content, data, information, applications
        or materials from third parties, including Your data, or provide links to additional third-party websites ("Data and Materials"). By using the Service, You acknowledge and agree that Hubstaff is not responsible for examining or evaluating the
        content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright or trademark compliance, legality, decency, quality or any other aspect of the Websites. Hubstaff does not warrant or endorse and does not assume and will not have any liability
        or responsibility to You or any other person for any data and materials on the Websites. To the extent You choose to access such Websites, You do so at Your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including,
        but not limited to, applicable local laws. Hubstaff reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to the Websites at any time without notice. In no event will Hubstaff be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to any
        such Websites. Hubstaff may also impose limits on the use of or access to certain Websites, in any case and without notice or liability. You agree to use the Websites at Your sole risk and that Hubstaff shall not have any liability to You for
        content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.</p>
    <h5>10. User content</h5>
    <p>You agree that all information, data, text, sound, photographs, graphics, video, software, or other materials submitted, posted or displayed by You on or through the Service ("User Content") is your sole responsibility. Hubstaff claims no ownership
        or control over any User Content. By submitting, posting or displaying User Content on or through the Service, you grant Hubstaff a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable license to use, reproduce, and adapt, such User Content to
        provide the Service to You. By submitting, posting or displaying User Content which is intended to be shared or made available to the general public, including through Hubstaff Talent, you grant Hubstaff a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free
        license to reproduce, adapt, distribute and publish such User Content through the Service and for the purpose of promoting Hubstaff and its services.</p>
    <p>As a condition of using the Service, You agree not to use the Service to infringe the intellectual property rights of others in any way. You represent that You have the right to grant, or that the holder of any rights, including moral rights in such
        content has completely and effectively waived all such rights and validly and irrevocably granted to You the right to grant, the license stated above. If You post User Content in any public area of the Service, You also permit any User to access,
        display, view, store and reproduce such User Content for personal use. Subject to the foregoing, the owner of such User Content placed in the Service retains any and all rights that may exist in such User Content.</p>
    <p>Hubstaff may review and refuse to accept or remove any User Content in its sole discretion. Hubstaff reserves the right to expel Users and prevent their further access to the Services for violating these terms or applicable laws, rules or regulations.
        Hubstaff may take any action with respect to User Content that it deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion if it believes that such User Content could create liability for Hubstaff, damage Hubstaff’s public image or business. It is
        Hubstaff’s policy to terminate the accounts of any Users who are repeat infringers of the copyrights, or other intellectual property rights, of others.</p>
    <p>Any profile You submit must accurately describe You, as an individual person, or an agency or organization that you are authorized to create a profile for. Profiles derived from User Content may be made available through the Service. Hubstaff does
        not make any representations regarding the accuracy or validity of such derived profiles, which may differ significantly from User Content.</p>

                restriction of Processing, erasure ("right to be forgotten"), data portability, object to the Processing, or its right not to be subject to an automated individual decision making ("Data Subject Request"). Taking into account the nature

                Laws and Regulations. In addition, to the extent Customer, in its use of the Services, does not have the ability to address a Data Subject Request, Hubstaff shall upon Customer’s request provide commercially reasonable efforts to assist
                Customer in responding to such Data Subject Request, to the extent Hubstaff is legally permitted to do so and the response to such Data Subject Request is required under Data Protection Laws and Regulations. To the extent legally permitted,
                Customer shall be responsible for any costs arising from Hubstaff’s provision of such assistance.</p>
            <h5>4. HUBSTAFF PERSONNEL</h5>

            <p class="ml-5"><span class="bold">5.1 Appointment of sub-processors.</span> Customer acknowledges and agrees that (a) Hubstaff’s Affiliates may be retained as Sub-processors; and (b) Hubstaff and Hubstaff’s Affiliates respectively may engage third-party
                Sub-processors in connection with the provision of the Services. Hubstaff or a Hubstaff Affiliate has entered into a written agreement with each Sub-processor containing data protection obligations not less protective than those in these
                Terms with respect to the protection of Customer Data to the extent applicable to the nature of the Services provided by such Sub-processor.</p>
            <p class="ml-5"><span class="bold">5.2 List of current sub-processors and notification of new sub-processors.</span> Hubstaff shall make available to Customer the current list of Sub-processors for the Services. Such Sub-processor lists shall include the
                identities of those Sub-processors and their country of location. Hubstaff shall provide notification of a new Sub-processor(s) before authorizing any new Sub-processor(s) to Process Personal Data in connection with the provision of the
                applicable Services.</p>
            <p class="ml-5"><span class="bold">5.3 Objection right for new sub-processors.</span> Customer may object to Hubstaff’s use of a new Sub-processor by notifying Hubstaff promptly in writing within ten (10) business days after receipt of Hubstaff’s notice in
                accordance with the mechanism set out in Section 5.2. In the event Customer objects to a new Sub-processor, as permitted in the preceding sentence, Hubstaff will use reasonable efforts to make available to Customer a change in the Services
                or recommend a commercially reasonable change to Customer’s configuration or use of the Services to avoid Processing of Personal Data by the objected-to new Sub-processor without unreasonably burdening the Customer. If Hubstaff is unable
                to make available such change within a reasonable period of time, which shall not exceed thirty (30) days, Customer may terminate the applicable Services with respect only to those Services which cannot be provided by Hubstaff without
                the use of the objected-to new Sub-processor by providing written notice to Hubstaff. Hubstaff will refund Customer any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of such Services following the effective date of termination with respect
                to such terminated Services, without imposing a penalty for such termination on Customer.</p>
            <p class="ml-5"><span class="bold">5.4 Liability.</span> Hubstaff shall be liable for the acts and omissions of its Sub-processors to the same extent Hubstaff would be liable if performing the services of each Sub-processor directly under the terms of this
                PDPA, except as otherwise set forth in the Terms.</p>

            <p class="ml-5"><span class="bold">6.2 Third-party certifications and audits.</span> Hubstaff has obtained the third-party certifications and audits set forth in the Security, Privacy and Architecture Documentation. Upon Customer’s written request at reasonable
                intervals, and subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth in the Agreement, Hubstaff shall make available to Customer that is not a competitor of Hubstaff (or Customer’s independent, third-party auditor that is not a competitor
                of Hubstaff) a copy of Hubstaff’s then most recent third-party audits or certifications, as applicable.</p>

            <p>Hubstaff shall return Customer Data to Customer and, to the extent allowed by applicable law, delete Customer Data in accordance with the procedures and timeframes specified in the Security and Privacy Documentation.</p>

                thereby establishing a separate PDPA between Hubstaff and each such Authorized Affiliate subject to the provisions of the Agreement and this Section 9 and Section 10. Each Authorized Affiliate agrees to be bound by the obligations under
                this PDPA and, to the extent applicable, the Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, an Authorized Affiliate is not and does not become a party to the Terms, and is only a party to the PDPA. All access to and use of the Services and Content

                the rights and seek remedies under this PDPA, subject to the following:</p>
            <p class="ml-10"><span class="bold">9.3.1</span> Except where applicable Data Protection Laws and Regulations require the Authorized Affiliate to exercise a right or seek any remedy under this PDPA against Hubstaff directly by itself, the parties agree that
                (i) solely the Customer that is the contracting party to the Agreement shall exercise any such right or seek any such remedy on behalf of the Authorized Affiliate, and (ii) the Customer that is the contracting party to the Terms shall
                exercise any such rights under this PDPA not separately for each Authorized Affiliate individually but in a combined manner for all of its Authorized Affiliates together (as set forth, for example, in Section 9.3.2, below).</p>
            <p class="ml-10"><span class="bold">9.3.2</span> The parties agree that the Customer that is the contracting party to the Terms and shall, when carrying out an onsite audit of the procedures relevant to the protection of Personal Data, take all reasonable
                measures to limit any impact on Hubstaff and its Sub-Processors by combining, to the extent reasonably possible, several audit requests carried out on behalf of different Authorized Affiliates in one single audit.</p>
            <h5>10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h5>
            <p>Each party’s and all of its Affiliates’ liability, taken together in the aggregate, arising out of or related to this PDPA, and all PDPAs between Authorized Affiliates and Hubstaff, whether in contract, tort or under any other theory of liability,
                is subject to the ‘Limitation of Liability’ section of Terms, and any reference in such section to the liability of a party means the aggregate liability of that party and all of its Affiliates under the Terms and all PDPAs together. For
                the avoidance of doubt, Hubstaff's and its Affiliates’ total liability for all claims from the Customer and all of its Authorized Affiliates arising out of or related to the Agreement and each PDPA shall apply in the aggregate for all
                claims under both the Agreement and all PDPAs established under this Agreement, including by Customer and all Authorized Affiliates, and, in particular, shall not be understood to apply individually and severally to Customer and/or to
                any Authorized Affiliate that is a contractual party to any such PDPA.</p>
            <h5>11. EUROPEAN SPECIFIC PROVISIONS</h5>
